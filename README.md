# zohocrm-datasync
## Project Objective
The main goal of this project is to create a data sync tool that will automate the transfer of data from our internal database to Zoho CRM, allowing for seamless data integration and improved efficiency.

## Basic Outline of Data Sync Tool Workflow
Below is a basic outline of how the data sync tool will work to pull data from our SQL database using SQL replication, stage the data in a staging database, and then upload it to Zoho CRM through their API.

* SQL Replication
* Data Transformation and Validation (optional)
* Data Upload to Zoho CRM
* Scheduling and Automation

## Key Features:

* Automated data synchronization between your SQL database and Zoho CRM
* Optional data transformation and validation to ensure data integrity and compliance with Zoho CRM's format requirements
* Robust error handling, logging, and retry mechanisms for reliable data transfer
* Scheduling and automation capabilities to run the sync process at predefined intervals
* Two implementation options: Local Host and Microsoft Azure Cloud, catering to different organizational requirements and preferences
