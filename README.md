# zohocrm-datasync
## Project Objective
The main goal of this project is to create a data sync tool that will automate the transfer of data from our internal database to Zoho CRM, allowing for seamless data integration and improved efficiency.

## Basic Outline of Data Sync Tool Workflow
Below is a basic outline of how the data sync tool will work to pull data from our SQL database using SQL replication, stage the data in a staging database, and then upload it to Zoho CRM through their API.

* SQL Replication
* Data Transformation and Validation (optional)
* Data Upload to Zoho CRM
* Scheduling and Automation
